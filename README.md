touchdesigner file: final week 10.toe is the first thing you see when you open the file : strobing cube is created by using a movie file in to get the strobyness aswell as a noise, ramp, and comp for the colour and strobing. this is then combind with a box to get the final.

touchdesigner file: week 8 : final trippy.toe is in the far left container called final trippy (it has a comment next to it saying it the final : this is made by using a circle and a ramp to get the pink colour. it uses an  LFO for the speed of the rotation on the transform. the transform is also set to repeat for the tiling.

touchdesiger file: week 9.toe none of the nodes are in containers however it is in the far left cluster and i have added a coment saying its the final and i have added coments to the other ones saying that they arnt the final : just a not that the current setting look nothing like my final because i took a screen recording earlyer in the process. however the final uses 3 different noises with different settings joined togeather by a displaces then a comp. i didnt add a null for some reason so the final is in comp4.

open processing: scales : week 2 : this was really fun to play around with i did it all manualy and typed out all the cordnets for the different scales. it wasnt to hard once i figured out figured out the formuler but it took ages. it was also my firat time playeing round with using different colours.

open processing: my sketch : week 4 : one of my first times playing found with random. i dont know why by i really liked the look of how this turned out.

open processing: spin : week 6 : i made this entirely by acsedent because my enitial idea was to have lots of spinny things at different points in the screen but this happend instead and i think its wayu cooler. i was working with translate and i just copie the fist statment down about 40 times and didnt change any of the settings.
